# o!hsu
osu! hitsound updater
---
Welcome! o!hsu is a simple program that allows you to change the hitsounds of any skin for the game osu!. For now it is a terminal based program, but a GUI version should be out **soon**(?)

This was just made as a fun project, fueled by the fact I don't like some skins solely due to their hitsounds.

If you wish to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request, no guarantee it will make it in, but I'll try my best to accomodate any changes ðŸ™‚

* *Currently just for osu!stable, support for osu!lazer would probably be the most complicated programming thing i've ever done, however I would like to get full parity no matter the client eventually.*
