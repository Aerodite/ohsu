# o!hsu
osu! hitsound updater
---
Welcome! o!hsu is a simple program that allows you to change the hitsounds of any skin for the game osu!. For now it is a terminal based program, but a GUI version should be out **soon**(?)

This was just made as a fun project, fueled by the fact I don't like some skins solely due to their hitsounds.
